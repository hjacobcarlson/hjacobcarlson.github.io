Jake is an urban and political sociologist, focused on democracy, housing, and changing cities. His current research examines the various causes and consequences of gentrification and displacement - and the relationships between the two.

Jake is currently a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University's [Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences](https://www.brown.edu/academics/spatial-structures-in-social-sciences/) (S4) and the [Population Studies and Training Center](https://www.brown.edu/academics/population-studies/) (PSTC). Jake was previously a Dissertation Fellow with the [Institute for Research on Poverty](https://www.irp.wisc.edu/training/ph-d-student-research-fellowships/), a Visiting Scholar at NYU's [Urban Democracy Lab](http://urbandemos.nyu.edu/), and a Research Fellow at [Participatory Budgeting Project](http://participatorybudgeting.org/).

summary = "Participatory budgeting (PB) is a process where everyday people come up with ideas for and vote on how to spend public money. By getting people directly involved in issues that affect their community, many hope that this form of participatory democracy will have broader impacts on the civic and political life of communities. In a collaborative project with [Carolina Johnson](https://csjohns.github.io/csjohns/) and Sonya Reynolds, we use quasi-experimental methods to test whether people are more likely to vote in regular elections after they participate in PB. To do so, we created a unique dataset that matches participatory budgeting voters in New York City with their state voter files. This provides the full voter history before and after voting in PB."

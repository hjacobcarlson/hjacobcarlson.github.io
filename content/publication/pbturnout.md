abstract = "The *participation hypothesis* suggests that the act of participating in civic activities encourages further engagement in other spheres of civic life. Testing the hypothesis that participation begets more participation is made difficult by the problem of selection bias in favor of those otherwise predisposed to participate. While the specific form of the participation outcome varies, a common measure is later voter turnout. In this paper, we examine the effect of individual involvement in participatory budgeting in New York City on subsequent voter turnout."

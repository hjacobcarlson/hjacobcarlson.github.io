abstract: "While state legislative rollbacks of public-sector workers' collective\
  \ bargaining rights in Wisconsin and other US states in 2011 appeared to signal\
  \ an unprecedented wave of hostility toward the public sector, such episodes have\
  \ a long history. Drawing on recent work on ``governance repertoires,'' this article\
  \ compares antistate initiatives in Wisconsin in 2011 to two previous periods of\
  \ conflict over the size and shape of government: the 1930s and the 1970s. We find\
  \ that while small government advocates in all three periods used similar language\
  \ and emphasized comparable themes, the outcomes of their advocacy were different\
  \ due to the distinct historical moments in which they unfolded and the way local\
  \ initiatives were linked to political projects at the national level. We explore\
  \ the relationship of local versions of small government activism to their national-level\
  \ counterparts in each period to show how national-level movements and the ideological,\
  \ social, and material resources they provided shaped governance repertoires in\
  \ Wisconsin. We argue that the three moments of conflict over the size of government\
  \ are deeply intertwined with the prehistory, emergence, and rise to dominance of\
  \ neoliberal political rationality and can provide insight into how that new ``governance\
  \ repertoire'' was experienced and built at the local level."

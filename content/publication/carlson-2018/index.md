abstract: Bangalore is held up as a model for how cities, particularly in the global
  south, should develop in the globalized information age, in which entrepreneurs
  with new access to international capital fuel service-sector-driven development.
  Expanding market forces cultivate cities of skilled middle-class workers whose increased
  consumption generates broad developmental benefits. Now known as the ``Silicon Valley
  of India,'' Bangalore was previously the capital of India's public sector enterprises
  (PSEs), which laid important groundwork for the city of today, including the IT
  sector. I show how, by providing access to homeownership along with high wages and
  benefits tied to secure employment, Bangalore's PSEs created the foundation for
  the city today and its middle-class character. The skilled workforce that PSEs created
  helped the IT sector emerge in the city. By examining this erased history, we see
  the role of the state in development projects, and consider alternative models for
  urban change.

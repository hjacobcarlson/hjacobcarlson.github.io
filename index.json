Such initiatives often aspire to create more activated citizens, but there is still limited empirical research validating these claims. We link participants in New York City's participatory budgeting process to their state voter file records to test whether PB increases participants' likelihood of voting in regular elections. We use coarsened exact matching to identify similar voters from council districts where PB was not implemented. Comparing PB voters to similar individuals who were not exposed to PB, we find that engaging with participatory budgeting increased indi-viduals' probability of voting by an average of 8.4 percentage points. In addition, we find that these effects are greater for those who often have lower probabilities of voting— young people, lower educated and lower income voters, black voters, and people who are the minority race of their neighborhood.","tags":[],"title":"Testing the Participation Hypothesis: Evidence from Participatory Budgeting","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Overview The Social Housing Development Authority (SHDA) is a proposed new federal institution to address the wave of distressed real estate as a result of the pandemic. The Authority would 1) acquire distressed real estate, 2) rehabilitate the property to livability and environmental standards, and 3) transfer the property to the \u0026ldquo;social housing\u0026rdquo; sector (community land trusts, tenant cooperatives, mission-driven nonprofits, public housing, and others).

Since the dependent variable — displacement — is difficult to measure, researchers resort to a variety of proxy measures for it. I classify three types of proxies: a population approach that measures compositional changes in neighborhoods over time, an individual approach that measures individual housing mobility, and a motivational approach that traces both individual mobility as well as the reasons why a household moved to determine whether that move was involuntary. I examine the prevalence of these approaches across a sample of the literature. I then test the commensurability of the proxy measures with data from New York City by comparing the rank orderings of neighborhoods with the most and least displacement. I find widely different results across the approaches. I explain these results by examining the underlying mechanisms of displacement that are masked by the other approaches.","tags":[],"title":"Measuring Displacement: Assessing Proxies for Involuntary Residential Mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Expanding market forces cultivate cities of skilled middle-class workers whose increased consumption generates broad developmental benefits. Now known as the ``Silicon Valley of India,'' Bangalore was previously the capital of India's public sector enterprises (PSEs), which laid important groundwork for the city of today, including the IT sector. I show how, by providing access to homeownership along with high wages and benefits tied to secure employment, Bangalore's PSEs created the foundation for the city today and its middle-class character. The skilled workforce that PSEs created helped the IT sector emerge in the city. By examining this erased history, we see the role of the state in development projects, and consider alternative models for urban change.","tags":[],"title":"Model Employers and Model Cities?: Bangalore's Public Sector and the Rise of the Neoliberal City","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jane L.

Drawing on recent work on ``governance repertoires,'' this article compares antistate initiatives in Wisconsin in 2011 to two previous periods of conflict over the size and shape of government: the 1930s and the 1970s. We find that while small government advocates in all three periods used similar language and emphasized comparable themes, the outcomes of their advocacy were different due to the distinct historical moments in which they unfolded and the way local initiatives were linked to political projects at the national level. We explore the relationship of local versions of small government activism to their national-level counterparts in each period to show how national-level movements and the ideological, social, and material resources they provided shaped governance repertoires in Wisconsin. We argue that the three moments of conflict over the size of government are deeply intertwined with the prehistory, emergence, and rise to dominance of neoliberal political rationality and can provide insight into how that new ``governance repertoire'' was experienced and built at the local level.","tags":[],"title":"State Phobia, Then and Now: Three Waves of Conflict over Wisconsin's Public Sector, 1930– 2013","type":"publication"}]
